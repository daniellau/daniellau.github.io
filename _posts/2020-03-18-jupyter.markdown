Jupyter.org aims to guide and inform individuals, organizations, contributors, and sponsors about Project Jupyterâ€™s core values, technology, and community.

The current website does not effectively communicate this information to these parties. This problem calls for a complete website re-design.

UX principles will be used to analyze the issues with the experience and how it could be improved. 

## What is Jupyter?

Jupyter software is a suite of free tools designed for interactive and reproducible computing. It consists of three major layers: kernel, middle ware, and application. Each layer is interchangeable.

These tools can support interactive computing and data analysis across any programming language. Users around the world have used them for various purposes such as academia, research, industry, and journalism.
