Sketching is about designing, not drawing. For years, I made the mistake of quickly going to mockups for projects at work. I didnâ€™t value sketching very much, thinking that my own drawing abilities were insufficient in bringing to life ideas I had in mind. My best work was limited to mockup tools and brief iterations of my initial design. Stripped of fancy software, sketching allows me to quickly get any and all ideas on paper.
